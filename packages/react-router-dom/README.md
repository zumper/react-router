# @zumper/react-router-dom

DOM bindings for [React Router](https://reacttraining.com/react-router).

This package is a fork of [react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router/). The only material difference is the addition of a `compile` function that allows for regex patterns when matching routes.
